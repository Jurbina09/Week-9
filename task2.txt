1. Open SQL Server Management Studio 
2. Connect to Northwind DB (Same DB as you used in Geek Week)

3. Write a query that shows each employee’s first name and the 
number of orders they have placed. Group the results by employee’s first name.

Please copy & paste your SQL query below AND add an explanation of the query: 

SELECT FirstName, COUNT(*) AS NumberOfOrders 
FROM Orders o
JOIN Employees e
ON e.EmployeeID = o.EmployeeID
GROUP BY o.EmployeeID, FirstName
ORDER BY NumberOfOrders DESC

This query groups the table Orders by Employee ID, and counts the number of rows for each unique employee ID. It also joins the Orders table with the Employees table using EmployeeID as the foreign key. The Select clause defines two columns (FirstName, and NumberOfOrders) to be displayed in the output. The results are sorted by descending order of NumberOfOrders.
